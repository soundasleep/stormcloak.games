To kick things off, [I've created a Patreon!](https://patreon.com/jevon) 100% of anything raised
will go towards developing the video games that I want to play.

I have zero expectations for it though, especially since I haven't even released
screenshots, videos, a playable demo, or anything...

Well, ok! Here is a very, _very_ early screenshot showing some of the
temporary programmer art in place. Right now I am focusing on prototyping
and refining the gameplay loop, and building out the capabilities of the engine.

(The character art is based on concept art by the incredibly talented

As you can see here I've implemented some basic element simulations, animation,
commands, tiles, temperature, and right now I'm exploring adding lighting to
the world.

There's still a _ton_ of ideas and experimentation I have to do before I'd
feel progressing the game to preproduction phase, though.

And no; the game doesn't have a name yet ðŸ˜… I have a few ideas floating around...
