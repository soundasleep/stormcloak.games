If you find any bugs, issues, balance problems or suggestions,
please let us know on [Discord](/discord) or [by email](mailto:jevon@stormcloak.games) so we can keep improving the game! ðŸ™‚
I'm really proud of all the work that we've managed to pull together for this release,
and I'm excited to hear your feedback.

## New game screen

At the start of the game, you will now be presented with your team, and you can reshuffle
them using a random seed. You can also re-use the same seed from a previous game to keep
your previous team.

If you've received one of our exclusive team postcards, you can
enter in this code here too!

## New art and tutorial

There is a lot of new art in the game! We've redone all of the [solid elements](/2023/09/22/solid-element-art) (dirt,
rock, ice, coal, etc.) and cleaned up the element edges tileset. We have also completely redesigned your crashed ship at the start of the game,
with beautiful new art and a new base entrance.

Finally, I've also added a new simple seven-step tutorial to the game, to help new players get started.
You can turn the tutorials on/off in the Options screen.
I'd like to know if this tutorial is helpful or not â€“ please let me know.

## Conversations

Pawns now have a "social" level, and talk with each other when their social levels
are low. These appear as little speech bubbles in-game, and the text (and replies)
are based on their personality types, their traits and buffs, and what's been
happening in game. [Cass](/2023/07/17/diary-entries) is going to be adding a lot more content!

## Space exposure and background parallax

There is now a new "space exposure" attribute on tiles in space â€“ gases and liquids
exposed to these tiles will gradually lose mass. (Previously this would only occur at the
edges of the game world.)

We've also used this to add a new space background with parallax that is gorgeous ðŸ¥°

## And a lot more

* Fog of war for unexplored areas
* Added an inline feedback message when the player is unable to perform an action
* "Dig-and-build": you can now place build errands over solid tiles, and pawns will
  automatically dig them out first
* Pawns no longer stand around idle in doorways
* Pawns should no longer be spawned on the top of your crashed ship
* Pawn pathfinding fixes
* Trees now consider the light levels across all of their cells, not just their base, when calculating aliveness
* Heaps of bug fixes and performance improvements

Full patch notes below.

## What's next?

- Save & load game
- Configurable pawn priorities
- Resource counters
- Tools for streamers
- Oxygen generators, plants, and food systems
