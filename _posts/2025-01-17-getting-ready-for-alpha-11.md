Happy new year â€“ and this is a big year for us, because Adaptory is
[coming to Early Access this year](/2024/02/14/next-fest-whats-next)!

We are hard at work right now getting ready for our next demo release, _Alpha 11_,
and it's just days away from release.
While most of the content we have added over the last few months has
[gone into the Early Access version](/2024/02/14/next-fest-whats-next),
there will be some new buildings and systems for you to play with in the demo,
and this free update will be coming to [itch.io](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory)
and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/).

While we wait for the final testing results and release art,
I've been focusing on polishing up the demo,
tweaking things, fixing bugs, and generally improving the user experience:

And so many other things... the patch notes has 100+ items so far. We can't wait to get the update to you!
