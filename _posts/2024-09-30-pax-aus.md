Thanks again to the incredible support from [CODE NZ](https://www.nz-code.nz),
we are thrilled to be coming back to [PAX Australia](https://aus.paxsite.com/) with Adaptory... next week!
We had [such a blast last year](https://stormcloak.games/updates/update10.html), meeting so many new friends and fans,
and can't wait to return.

If you're in Melbourne next week (11-13 October 2024),
make sure to pop by **CODE NZ booth #1140**,
where you can play Adaptory and [17 other amazing New Zealand-made indie games](https://www.nz-code.nz/post/code-brings-18-of-aotearoa-s-best-indie-games-to-pax-aus).
Come have a chat with the solo developer (me!), composer, and sound designer, play the
latest build, and pick up some exclusive swag.

We'll be posting updates and photos on our [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@stormcloak) and maybe [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StormcloakGames) too.
