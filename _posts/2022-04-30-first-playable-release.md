This week, I'm focusing on my application to [Kiwi Game Starter 2022](https://nzgda.com/news/kiwi-game-starter-2022-call-for-entries/),
which "is the NZGDAâ€™s annual game development award and startup programme for interactive games businesses and startups."

The submission involves lots of business and marketing practice, which is really good for me.
But more excitingly, the submission requires a playable demo of your game!

Which means that next week,
**I'm going to be releasing a very early pre-alpha to [my $10 Patreons](https://patreon.com/jevon)**.
The pre-alpha is very short, and only on Windows, but it is playable.

So if you'd like to get (very) early access, consider [becoming a patron](https://patreon.com/jevon)!
