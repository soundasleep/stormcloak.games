Happy new year again ðŸŽ‰ I hope you're having (or had) a great break. I [took the month of December off](https://www.patreon.com/posts/pausing-next-74607037)
to recharge, but now I'm back into gamedev (and loving it). 2023 is going to be a big year!!

I'm aiming for an [Alpha 2 release](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory) in just under four weeks time â€“
the end of January. Thanks to everyone who has [downloaded a copy](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory) so far and provided feedback ðŸ˜Š

Right now I'm working on a new gameplay mechanic that should be in this release. Introducing: **electricity!**

Some of the new buildings include:

* **Consumers**, which require power to function (such as lights or refinement machines);
* **Generators**, which generate power on demand (such as solar panels or coal burners); and
* **Batteries**, which store any excess generated power, to be released later.

There are also **wires** which connect all of your powered buildings together. These can be built behind other buildings, but not solid tiles (like dirt).

This is still very much a work in progress, but it's feeling great so far.
