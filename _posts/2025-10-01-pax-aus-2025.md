We are thrilled to be once again coming back to [PAX Aus 2025](https://aus.paxsite.com/) in Melbourne next week, **October 10-12**!
We will be part of the [CODE NZ](https://www.nz-code.nz) booth, **stand #1840**,
with [seventeen other amazing New Zealand-made games](https://www.screenhub.com.au/news/games/pax-aus-2025-code-nz-games-lineup-2680446/).

Come and play our **exclusive booth demo** showcasing all of the latest and unreleased Adaptory content.
You'll be able to play with the research tree, new world generation,
discover alien ruins, and [meet CHARLI](/2025/09/03/alpha-13).

This is also the **last time** that we'll be bringing Adaptory to an event
before our [planned Early Access release](/2025/09/03/alpha-13), so I'm trying to
get as much playtesting and feedback on the game as possible. Don't be shy!
If you are a content creator, reviewer, or streamer – [please get in touch](mailto:hello@stormcloak.games)
and we can do something cool together.

If you've met us at a previous PAX, please pop in and say hi – we'll have some
special goodies to share with you to say thanks.

Thank you so so much [CODE NZ](https://www.nz-code.nz) for bringing us one more time <3
