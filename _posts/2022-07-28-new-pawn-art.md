Very excited to be finally sharing this news! Adaptory is getting new
art by [@careously](https://twitter.com/careously)!

Over the last few months I've been exploring these new styles with Care
and I'm really happy with where we've landed.
It is [quite a change](/2022/06/14/giving-pawns-orders) â€“
the new style is less gritty, and more playful â€“ but I think it's going
to look awesome once it's finished. Seeing the new art come to life
was incredibly rewarding.

I've been using this as an opportunity to clean up the pawn animations, too.
Under the hood I've now got four separate animation tracks (facing, activity,
mood, and eyes) that integrate together. But that does mean I'll be re-animating
about a dozen tracks over the next few weeks. And I'll need to redo all
the art assets, title imagery, etc. Still a _lot_ more work to do! ðŸ˜Š
