Exciting news (for Mac owners) â€“ Adaptory will now be supported on Apple Silicon!
If you're playing Adaptory on an M1 or newer, you can expect the game to be at least twice faster
and less resource intensive.

More specifically, Adaptory will be built with both `x86_64` (Intel) and `aarch64`/`arm64` (Apple) binaries,
and when starting up the game using Steam, you will receive a prompt asking which version you'd like to run:

Until Java is able to [build universal binaries](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8310587),
or Steam allows developers to specify architecture-specific launch options,
this prompt was the best solution I could come up with ðŸ˜…

Mac Arm64 builds will be available in next Adaptory demo alpha release.
