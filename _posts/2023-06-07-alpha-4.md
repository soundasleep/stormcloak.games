Alpha 4 is now live! This release does not have any new content in it,
but it has a [rewritten data model](/2023/06/05/new-data-model)
that should run simulations up to 2-10x faster. All things going well,
this should be the final model used through to EA/1.0 release.

If you're able to download a copy and give it a go, please let me know
if you find any weird bugs! I've had to touch almost every part of the game
so there is bound to be a few areas I've missed.

### Internal

- Added fullscreen mode, toggle with `F5` or in the Options window
- Added experimental UI scaling slider in Options window
- Added new speed level `4`, which tries to run simulations at 25x speed
- Default game window is now 1440x960

### Fixes

- Fixed two items in the same cell with different item types merging, they shouldn't do that
