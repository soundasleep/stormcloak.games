It has been a while since the last blog post! [Gamescom 2023](/2023/06/28/gamescom)
was an _incredible_ experience (coupled with jetlag that took about a week to recover),
and then I went straight into NZGDC to [show off the game at the Kiwi Interactive Showcase](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@stormcloak/110988165411722689/).

And there has not been a moment to rest!
We're now getting ready for presenting the game to the public at [PAX Melbourne](https://aus.paxsite.com/)
in two weeks time! We will be at the **NZ CODE - Booth #1140** in the expo hall,
[along with 19 other New Zealand-made games](https://www.nz-code.nz/post/code-brings-20-of-aotearoa-s-best-indie-games-to-pax-aus).
I'm really excited to show the game off to the public, I expect it will be like
a super amped up [Armageddon expo](/2023/05/30/alpha-4-is-coming).

At PAX, **one** of the things we'll be showing off is brand new solid element art that Care has been working on ‚ù§Ô∏è
It is beautiful and really makes the game pop.
From 12 o'clock, going clockwise: sand, dirt, graphite, coal, basalt, ice, salt, and gold.
With a few blocks of transmitite.

The next release (Alpha 6) is almost ready and will be presented at PAX AU,
but I don't think I'll [release it on itch.io](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory)
until _after_ PAX ‚Äì that way it's an exclusive experience for attendees üòÖ
