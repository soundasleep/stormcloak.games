I'm very excited to finally announce that,
Adaptory will be part of [Indie Arena Booth](https://indiearenabooth.de/gamescom2025/games)
at [Gamescom 2025](https://www.gamescom.global/en), the "biggest games event in the world!"

With the incredible support of [CODE NZ](https://www.nz-code.nz/) once more,
we have an **arcade booth** as part of Indie Arena Booth,
at **Hall 10.2, Booth F010g - E019g**. Right now I'm in the middle
of designing some custom artwork and bits and bobs to make
our booth really stand out. ðŸ˜Š

[I went to Gamescom two years ago](/2023/06/28/gamescom) with the support of CODE and
absolutely loved Indie Arena Booth in particular. There were so many cool games
and cool developers (including Tarn from Dwarf Fortress!!) and
I am genuinely thrilled to be part of the space this year.
Look at all of these amazing games!

This year I'll be coming with Care for the entire week (12 hour days &#x1FAE0;),
and we'll be promoting Adaptory to press, media, streamers, and content creators
from all over the world. If you know anyone who might be there, please
send them our way! We'll have a brand new, **Gamescom-exclusive demo** for
everyone to play.

I'll be posting updates on our [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/stormcloak.games) and
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@stormcloak) so make sure to follow us there if you haven't already.
I'll also make sure to take some photos and share some
of the incredible experiences [on my Patreon, like last time](https://www.patreon.com/posts/photos-from-88357463).
