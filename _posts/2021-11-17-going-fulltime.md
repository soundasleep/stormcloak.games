With the incredible support of my partner K (thank you!), it's official.
I've decided to take the plunge,
and go fulltime on developing video games!!

ðŸ¤¯ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’–

But first, a bit of history:

I've been working on this game (which still doesn't have a title, shh ðŸ˜œ)
in the background since Feb 2021. This isn't
the first time I've tried to make a game, and [my commit history](https://github.com/soundasleep) is littered
with experiments, such as:

* [rcd](https://github.com/soundasleep/rcd), a text-based multiplayer dungeon crawler
  made in a weekend
* [hacktrain](https://github.com/soundasleep/hacktrain), an attempt at creating
  a 3D train network game using JMonkeyEngine
* [ResourceGame](https://github.com/soundasleep/Unreal_ResourceGame), a resource management
  game that was mostly a bunch of Unreal Engine experiments pasted together
* [rrw](https://github.com/soundasleep/rrw), a multiplayer Ruby on Rails RPG world thing
* [rmagic](https://github.com/soundasleep/rmagic), a very basic implementation of
  Magic: the Gathering in Ruby on Rails (yes, that one was a stretch lol)
* and plenty more... seriously... the list is endless. Apparently I've been making games
  for longer than I can remember!?

But the game that I'm working on right now is the first time I've had the _buzz_
of not only creating a game world, but seeing the game _come alive_. I want to
see what happens next!

And seemingly without warning (thanks mostly to savings, hard work, and some very fortuitous investments.
I am so incredibly lucky and privileged),
today I have the opportunity to answer a question I'd never considered before:

> I have the opportunity, the skills, the experience, and
> the support. Should I finally try taking this videogame stuff seriously?

I've decided that yes. Now is the time!

Life is not a dress rehearsal, and I think Covid has reminded us all of what's actually important.
