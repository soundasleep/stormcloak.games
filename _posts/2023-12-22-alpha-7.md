If you find any bugs, issues, balance problems or suggestions,
please let us know on [Discord](/discord) or [by email](mailto:jevon@stormcloak.games) so we can keep improving the game! ðŸ™‚

The focus of this release has been technology, to try get the game as stable as possible
before adding all of the systems and content for Early Access.
This release has been heavily tested but there may be some bugs, so please let us know.

## New art

We've replaced all of the raw resource pile art with brand new art, and it looks amazing.
There's different art for small and big piles, and whether the piles are falling through space
or are settled on the ground.
Explorers also show what they're carrying â€“ whether raw elements, or items such as oxygen candles.

There's also new art and animations for the battery and light buildings.

## Tools for streamers

We're starting to add some tools for streamers to play the game with their community! To start off,
you're now able to rename your explorers. You can change their name at the start of the game,
or in the middle of a game by clicking on their name:

</figure>

## Resource counting

Not sure if you're running low on construction materials? Is your oxygen candle supply getting dangerously low?
We've added a resource counter that automatically works out how many resources your crew is able to use.
(It does not include resources that are buried, locked away behind doors, or otherwise inaccessible.)

</figure>

## Save and load

You can now save and load your game in Adaptory, allowing for longer play sessions.
This also means you can share save games with your friends, and perhaps collaborate on a base together!

Autosave has also been added (by default every ten minutes). Occasional game crashes
should no longer be the end of your game. Save/load is experimental so [please let us know](/feedback)
if your save game doesn't load properly.

## New audio and FMOD support

Alpha 7 marks our first release with sound design contributed by [Mika](https://mikattemusic.com/)!
We have been adding lots of extra clicks and sounds and adaptive audio throughout the game.
There's also three new music tracks in the game, including a music loop played in the main menu â€“
I recommend listening to the music with headphones, if possible!

This release also switches our audio engine from [OpenAL](/2022/06/07/spatial-sounds)
to [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com) ([more information](/2023/11/18/save-game)).

## And a lot more

- More descriptions added to items and elements
- Animated dialogs for alerts and popup menus
- Brand new scrollbars that feel better and are more accessible
- A shiny new splash screen at the start of the game
- Command-line switches
- Windowed fullscreen mode
- And of course, lots of bug fixes and performance improvements

Full patch notes below.

## What's next?

We will be participating in [Steam Next Fest Feb 2024](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/nextfest/2024feb)
so most of the next few weeks we will be focusing on getting
our demo and [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/) polished.

Shortly after Steam Next Fest, the plan is to [_officially enter Early Access!_](/2023/07/21/ea-release-2024)
The EA version of Adaptory will include:

- Oxygen generator and gas transfer buildings (these needed a bit of a simulation rewrite, which is why it's not in A7)
- Configurable explorer priorities and jobs
- Storage for resources, artefacts, and explorers
- A refreshed and modern user interface design
- Plants and food production
- A basic research tree
