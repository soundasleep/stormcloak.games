We are [thrilled to announce today](https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/2201620/announcements/detail/4363510595758059373)
that we are teaming up with
[indie.io (formerly Freedom Games)](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/indieio)
as the **publisher for Adaptory! ðŸ¥³**

Weâ€™ve been working towards this collaboration for many months and we are very excited that itâ€™s now official. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥°

### Whatâ€™s next for Adaptory?

Weâ€™re still [aiming for an Early Access release in 2025](/2024/02/14/next-fest-whats-next)
as we add more content and polish to Adaptory and refine its identity. Indie.io has **no**
control over whatâ€™s going to be in the game, and itâ€™s their healthy approach to IP
ownership that ultimately attracted us in the first place.
Our publisher will be responsible for Adaptoryâ€™s marketing, events, localisation,
trailers, and store pages, and this will help our very very small team focus on making Adaptory instead ðŸ˜Š

### About indie.io

For those of you who may not know, working with a game publishing platform like
[indie.io](https://indie.io) greatly helps indie developers focus on game development while they handle
all the behind-the-scenes magic. From helping manage store pages to crafting marketing
campaigns and even helping the game shine at both digital and live events,
indie.io helps in all the aspects that indie developers often struggle with alone.

### Join the party

We are thrilled to have the support of indie.io and we couldnâ€™t be here without
all of your help and support. Thank you for all of your messages, feedback, shares,
