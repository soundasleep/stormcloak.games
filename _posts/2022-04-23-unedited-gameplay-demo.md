It's been a good week. I've implemented [sleeping/passing out](/2022/04/16/thoughts-and-dreams),
updated some icons, cleaned up the animation machine logic, and added more depth to the element simulation.

(Now, pawns will gain – or lose – heat from their surroundings.
This doesn't have any immediate impact, because they don't feel hot or cold
or pain yet.)

I also spent time revamping the sound effects, which was actually
a lot more fun than I expected. Pawns now make footstep noises when
they walk around, making the game world feel more alive.

That means I'm happy to now share the first unedited demo video of the game, complete
with sound:
