Since the release of [Alpha 4](/2023/06/07/alpha-4) we have been doing a lot
of work on one of Adaptory's unique features â€“ the **diary entries** that your pawns write,
directed by the award-winning [Cassandra Tse](/team).

Through diary entries you can learn more about what and why a pawn is feeling and experiencing,
more about their history and relationships with the rest of the crew,
and the back story of the game world.

Previously, pawns would write a diary entry every X in-game hours, and only
in response to a specific game event.
Now, pawns can write diary entries from a number of sources:

- the first time that a specific [game event](/2023/03/16/random-events) has happened
- the first time a pawn achieves some milestone
- any time that a pawn has a particular buff or debuff
- any sort of statistic from the game world

Pawns will only write entries about recent events, and only about the things that matter the most
(to them). Their diary entries also have different content if they are happy or sad,
and there is different text for each personality type (nine in total).

For example, a sad "challenger" pawn may write the following after another crew member died:

<figure class="image">

  <figcaption>A sad "challenger" pawn diary entry about a pawn death</figcaption>
</figure>

Or, a happy (don't ask...) "achiever" pawn may write the following about the same event:

<figure class="image">
  <a href="/assets/screenshots/2023-07-08-happy-diary.png"><img src="/assets/screenshots/2023-07-08-happy-diary.png"></a>
  <figcaption>A happy "achiever" pawn diary entry about a pawn death</figcaption>
</figure>

The engine supports internationalisation as well, so we hope that players of different languages
can relate more closely with the events and experiences their pawns go through.

There are still some more features we want to add to the diary entry engine, as well as revamp the UI
to be more accessible and discoverable, so you can expect future updates!
