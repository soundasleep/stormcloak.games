With the support of [my publisher](/2024/08/09/publisher-announcement),
I'm very excited to announce the [brand new Adaptory trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dHjKjDnJiA)

This new trailer was premiered as part of the [incredible ANZ Indie Showcase 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt9wMBDUQR0),
which shows off an incredible collection of indie games made by Australian and
New Zealand indie games. (Adaptory's feature starts at the 23 minute mark!)

As part of the ANZ Indie Showcase, I was [interviewed by Caff about Adaptory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGTiOMGkP9I),
my motivation behind making the game, some of the design decisions we've made,
and also my favourite caffeinated beverage. ❤️

The next demo release of Adaptory is gradually coming together as well. While most of the
work over the last six months has been saved for the [Early Access release next year](/2024/02/14/next-fest-whats-next),
the demo update will have a lot of fixes and quality of life improvements.
I'm aiming for the new demo to be released by January.
