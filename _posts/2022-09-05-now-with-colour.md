We've finished up [the initial character art](/2022/07/28/new-pawn-art) for clothing, skins,
and expressions. and I think the pawns look great. They have a lot more personality now, and it should
be fairly easy to add more options.

I'm still hoping to release a [public alpha on itch.io](/2022/05/18/announcing-adaptory) this month,
however the timing might be a little tight. Wish me luck!
