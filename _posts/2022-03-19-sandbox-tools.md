I've continued to [focus on user interfaces](/2022/03/11/more-user-interfaces) for the
last week, and I'm happy with where it's at now. I've finished a lot of things that should form
a stable foundation for all my work going forward:

### üëç Debug console

There's now a debug console, which you can access with the tilde key `~`:

</figure>

(Internally the console is using [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/),
which means the console has access to all sorts of amazing features. You can even do math with it.)

### üëç Better sandbox tools

To make sure the UI code is stable and resilient, I rewrote the internal sandbox tools to
the new UI code. The sandbox tools are currently accessible through `F10` (or by
typing in `sandbox` into the debug console, although this will probably need to be hidden
behind a cheat code eventually):

### üëç Faster UI hotreloading code

For dev environments, I not only got the hotreloading in dev mode to work more reliably, but
it's also now significantly faster (almost immediate). The hotreloading code picks
up changes to essentially everything: textures, shaders, colours, properties, configuration, and more.

### What's next?

I'm keen to switch back into game design and gameplay mode next.
Doing this foundational work is important, but it is a grind, and as an ex-frontend and design systems
developer, it is too easy to get distracted trying to make frameworks üòÖ.
