This release is packed with new systems, gameplay, sounds, and art for you to play with.
And there's a [lot more coming](https://adaptorygame.com/roadmap)!

If you find any bugs, please
report them to [our Discord server](/discord) or [send me an email](mailto:jevon@stormcloak.games).
We've tested this build on a number of machines and setups but I'm sure there's a few
sneaky bugs hiding in the woodwork.
Thank you for all your feedback and support while we create Adaptory ðŸ™‚

### Random events

In Alpha 3, we've introduced [random world events](/2023/03/16/random-events)
that will challenge your base's ability to adapt.
The frequency and intensity of the random events increase based on the number of tiles that
you have dug, and the number of artifacts you've uncovered.

</figure>

This system is still very much WIP but the plan is to expand this out to many more types of
world and character events.

### Power layer

There's a [new power overlay](/2023/03/07/power-layer) which shows you your electricity network,
and where the conductive points of each building are. This layer turns on automatically
when you're building wires, or you can press `F4` to toggle it:

### New buildings

There are two new buildings to play with:

- **Beds** are buildings where your pawns can have a nap.
  When pawns are tired, they will prefer to seek out an unclaimed bed and sleep there,
  gaining a mood buff and faster stamina recovery.

- **Oxygen candles** are based on the real world, where you can burn a cartridge ("oxycan")
  to generate oxygen (and a lot of heat).
  When starting the game, you are provided three oxygen candles to help you get going â€“
  a few more are scattered throughout the world for you to find.

### Pawn happiness

Pawns now have a happiness/mood level, which can be affected by what they're doing, where they are,
and how comfortable they are. Their mood affects how fast they work, and eventually
this will affect how they write their diary entries, _what_ they write about,
the relationships they have with others, random world events, and more.

### Two new tracks by Sai Natarajan

Adaptory now has two tracks by the incredible composer [Sai Natarajan](https://www.viusstudios.com/bio),
and more are underway. The tracks are also featured in [our new Alpha 3 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipI3hEsth0A)!

Background music now plays with some silence between tracks to help you feel more immersed in the game world.
You can also turn continuous music back on in the game options.

### Refreshed graphics

A major part of this release are [new liquid, gas, and light shaders](/2023/02/21/new-liquid-shaders),
which have smoother edges, waves, bubbles, and better performance across a wider range of computers.

[Care](https://twitch.tv/careously) has also been working hard on new building art in this release,
and I've been refreshing the animations to go along with them. I've also fixed a rendering bug that vastly
improves the quality of text across all dialogs and windows.

### A lot more

There's also new art, new elements, faster simulations, alert bubbles,
a new crash handler dialog, and a ton of bug and crash fixes.
The full changelog is listed below!
