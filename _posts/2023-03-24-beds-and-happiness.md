Alpha 3 is fast approaching, make sure you [sign up to the mailing list](/updates)
to get notified! Over the last two weeks I have been focusing on improving
the gameplay by adding two major new features: pawn happiness, and beds.

## Happiness

Pawns now have a **happiness meter** which will go up and down based on what
they're experiencing, and [later this year](/2023/03/15/nzfc-interactive-development-fund) we're going to use
pawn happiness to trigger different types of diary entries.

To start off, pawns will work faster when they're happy, and slower when
they're particularly sad; they'll also express their emotions using
their cute faces.

I've also added a little help popup to show you all of the active effects
that are modifying pawn happiness, stamina, and working speed.

## Beds

There is also a new building: **beds!** When they are getting tired (around 20%
stamina), pawns will seek out an unclaimed bed, tuck themselves in, and sleep there â€“
instead of collapsing on the floor. While they're in bed they'll get a mood buff,
and recover their stamina much faster.

## New art

You may have also noticed that Care has been making more amazing art
for Adaptory! I'm gradually updating all of the building art with this
gorgeous new style, and hoping to get them all in the game before
Alpha 3. The game is looking so good!!
