I'm very happy to launch the latest free update to Adaptory today!
**Alpha 13** features CHARLI, your adorable helpful tutorial and guide.
There's also more unusual buildings and objects to discover,
and plenty of tweaks and polish to the demo.

You can [download the latest demo on itch.io](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory), or
[play the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/):

We're also excited to share that Adaptory will be part of [the ANZ Indie Showcase 2025](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2201620/view/508464827262305897),
and our [dear friend Zeppy](https://www.youtube.com/zeppygame) will be streaming Alpha 13 live!
Set your reminders, because Jevon will be hanging out in chat tomorrow ðŸ˜Š

## CHARLI

Introducing the brand new Computational Holographic Assistant for Resources, Logistics and Information â€“
also known as C.H.A.R.L.I., as your helpful guide and tutorial to Adaptory:

</figure>

CHARLI is introduced at the start of the game and gives you information, guidance, goals, and background
information as you play through the game. If you're very experienced, CHARLI can be minimised at
any time, but otherwise they'll just hang out in the top right corner, giving you guidance and help.
Our new animator Kat did an amazing job animating CHARLI and I can't wait to get more of her animations into the game ðŸ˜Š

</figure>

We've also rewritten the entire introduction and tutorial sequence in Alpha 13.
The tutorial is now more flexible, with multiple steps and stages,
based on what is actually happening in your game.
We've tested the tutorial in many different scenarios, and hopefully all of the bugs
are ironed out, but [please let me know if it breaks](/feedback)!

## Mysterious alien ruins and artefacts

  <figcaption>What have we found?</figcaption>
</figure>

While the planetoid you landed on initially appeared to be deserted,
as you dig down deeper, you will start discovering evidence of an ancient civilisation.
[With research](/2025/06/04/alpha-12), you might be able to gain knowledge from these abandoned
artefacts to look after your crew and ultimately resume your journey home...

(Ancient civilisation buildings and artefacts will only be generated in new save files.)

## Better control over prioritisation

I've tweaked explorer priorities to make a bit more sense, to be more controllable, and with better defaults:

* If two possible errands have an identical priority across all priority categories, they will now fallback to the
  left-to-right order listed in the priorities dialog.
* Explorers will now prioritise toggle errands over build errands, and build errands over dig errands.
* The "go to bed" errand has been moved into Personal, but explorers will still run to their assigned bed if they're
  close to passing out.

This _should_ improve explorer behaviour for large bases, and this should also improve your ability to configure who does what, and when.

## A lot of polish and tweaks

This release also has a lot of tweaks and improvements suggested by
players at [Gamescom](/2025/07/06/gamescom) and [PAX West](/2025/08/29/pax-west),
and by [our amazing community](/discord). Thank you very much for all of your feedback and ideas!
These include:

- The breathability overlay (`F1`) now also shows areas of unblocked space exposure
- Added "edge offset" option to increase the horizontal padding of user interfaces for ultrawide monitors
- Added option to show or hide the UPS/FPS panel
- Improved performance of user interface rendering by up to 50% by using runtime texture atlases
- Improved pathfinding performance
- Fog of war is now revealed as an ellipse, rather than a square
- Fixed looping sounds not restarting when a save file is loaded
- Fixed the user interface not working correctly in Turkish locales

The full patch notes are listed below.

## What's next?

Importantly, this is planned to be the **final demo update** before Early Access,
so that we can put all of our efforts into polishing our EA release.
The specific launch date for early access has not been announced yet, either.
Watch this space!

The unstable demo build will continue to be updated for our community testers,
so we can have an updated demo at launch;
if you'd like to continue playing the latest features, test improvements, and generally contribute
ideas and feedback for the development of Adaptory,
we'd love to have you join [the community testers group on Discord](/discord) ðŸ˜Š
