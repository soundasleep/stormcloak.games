If you can wishlist and share the game, that will help a lot ðŸ˜€

Today/tomorrow I'm releasing Alpha 2 of the game [on itch.io](https://soundasleepful.itch.io/adaptory) â€“
which involves sending out mailing updates, blog posts, writing release notes, all the jazz.
There's a lot more interesting gameplay in the next version, I hope you all enjoy it.
