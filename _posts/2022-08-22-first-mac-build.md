Over the last three weeks, I've been mostly focusing on getting Adaptory
working on Mac OS. [The engine I'm using](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/)
natively supports Mac, however I found out that its OpenGL support is
[much stricter](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6897).

Which meant I had to rewrite the graphics code. That was
three weeks of work I wasn't expecting!

But ‚Äì Adaptory now plays on Mac OS! The game is unoptimised and
the builds are unsigned, but it's a start.

I also attended [NZGDC 2022](https://nzgdc.com/) last week, a gamedev conference
here in New Zealand, and it was incredible. I loved meeting everyone
and the talks and the ideas and everything. ‚ù§Ô∏è I had a lot of feelings from the event, that I'm still processing ‚Äì
such as the realities of, and tension between, creating
art and being commercially successful ‚Äì but the community was immediately welcoming. üòä
