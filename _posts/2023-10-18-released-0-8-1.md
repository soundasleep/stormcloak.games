I've put together some quick fixes for [Alpha 6](/2023/10/11/alpha-6)
that should fix some of the most common crashes and unexpected behaviour.

# Release notes for Adaptory 0.8.1

### New Features

- Doors can now be locked by pawns, preventing pawns from getting through

### Simulation

- Pawns that build solid tiles on their head are now pushed out to the nearest non-solid tile, if any
- Idle pawns will now run to a breathable spot if their oxygen level is below 50%; non-idle pawns still work until 30%
- Pawns can be asked to Move (M) to a tile _above_ an accessible spot
- Added "cannot get here" inline feedback to Move (M)

### Balance

- Increased range of non-space exposure tiles under the starting crashed ship
- Increased pawn tile push-out speed from 0 to 0.06 sec
- At the start of the game, pawns have 90-100% stamina, rather than 100%

### Internal

- Added additional content in selected building, item, and pawn panels so there is less UI/UX jumping around
- Pawns and buildings can now be selected over their entire tile bounds, not just their 1x1 tile root
- Pawn oxygen bars are now displayed if the pawn cannot absorb oxygen, rather than only when their oxygen level is low
- Camera zoom is reset to the default when starting a new game
- Selecting a pawn using the top bar unselects any selected building or world action buttons

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash if a liquid pipe that was the source or target of a liquid packet was deconstructed
- Fixed a crash if two raw items tried to dissolve into the same tile
- Fixed a rare crash if a building, item, or pawn was selected
- Fixed a memory leak that would sometimes occur when calculating fog of war
- Fixed liquid network input/output icons not displaying on liquid pipe layer
- Fixed pawns running out into undiscovered areas when low on oxygen
