### Revamped diary engine

The [diary engine](/2023/07/17/diary-entries) has had a major overhaul,
thanks to a [grant from the NZFC Interactive Development fund](/2023/03/15/nzfc-interactive-development-fund).
Rather than pawns writing diary entries immediately after an event occurs,
the event may now become the _topic_ of a future diary entry.
As soon as the pawn wants to write a diary entry (generally once a day), they will select the most important topic to write about at that time.

<figure class="image">

</figure>

We've added in **pawn traits**, which affect how they deal with different situations.
For example, a pawn that _loves digging_ will work faster if they did a lot of digging
recently, or a pawn that is _afraid of the dark_ will get slightly sadder if their
environment isn't lit up. For now, each pawn will be assigned a single trait randomly.

</figure>

There are also four new **pawn buffs** which impact your pawns' productivity, happiness, and potential diary entries.

### Liquid networks

In Alpha 5, there are three new buildings for creating **liquid networks** â€“ a way to
suck up, transport, and release liquids throughout the world:

- _liquid pumps_, which are powered buildings, that suck up liquids to put into the network;
- _liquid vents_, that serve as exits for the liquid network; and
- _liquid pipes_, which actually transport liquids in the network around (to the nearest vent).

In future updates these networks will tie into other buildings, such as an _oxygen generator_ that will transform water into oxygen and hydrogen.

</figure>

There is also a **new liquid network overlay** which shows your liquid network,
and where the input and output points of the network are. This layer turns on automatically
whenever you're building liquid network-enabled buildings, or you can press `F6` to toggle it:

</figure>

### Pawn quick-access bar

I've added a new bar to the top of the screen where you can see _all_ of your
pawns, their names, and their current state. You can see if they're happy, sad,
sleeping, or dead... well hopefully not the last one:

</figure>

### And a lot more

There's also improved pawn AI, new tree art, a new oxygen bar,
an improved pause screen, closeable alert bubbles, graphics improvements,
and a ton of bug and crash fixes.
The full changelog is listed below!

# Release notes for Adaptory 0.7 (Alpha 5)

### New Features

- New diary entry engine!
  - When an event happens in the world, or to a pawn, or a particular buff, that may become the _topic_ of a future diary entry
  - As soon as the pawn wants to write a diary entry, they will select the most important topic to write about
  - Pawns use different diary templates based on their mood (happy, neutral, sad)
  - Rewrote most existing diary entries and added 12 new topic categories
  - Pawns no longer immediately write a diary entry at the start of the game
  - Diary entries are now shown in newest-to-oldest order
- Liquid networks!
  - Added liquid pumps, vents, and pipes that can suck up and transport any liquids
  - Liquid pumps require electricity to function
  - Added a liquid network layer that shows points in the network where liquids can enter and exit
  - The liquid network layer can also be accessed with the keyboard shortcut `F6`
- Added a new top bar for selecting and moving to your pawns
  - The top bar also shows their current mood (happy, sad, dead, etc)
- Updated tree with new art, and changed dimensions to 1x2
- Pawns can now have _traits_ which affect how different buffs and situations affect them, and the diary entries they write
- Selecting a pawn now shows what they're thinking about â€“ what's going on, or their next diary entry topic
- Issuing a move command to a sleeping pawn will now wake them up
- When pawns have low oxygen levels, an oxygen bar will now appear below them

### Simulation

- Buildings and pawns that are buried or otherwise covered by impassable tiles can no longer emit or absorb nearby elements
- When pawns are low on oxygen, they will now look for the nearest tile that has at least enough oxygen to sustain them, rather than the nearest tile that has _any_ oxygen

### Balance

- New pawn buffs
  - _in darkness_, which normally has no effect
  - _slept on floor_, which reduces pawn happiness if they recently slept on the floor
  - _did lots of digging yesterday_, if they spent more than 20% of their time yesterday doing dig errands
  - _someone recently died_, if any pawn died in the last day
- New pawn traits
  - _light-sensitive_, which negates the happiness buff from being in bright areas
  - _afraid of the dark_, which makes pawns unhappy if they're in the dark
  - _loves digging_ and _hates digging_, which increase or decrease happiness and pawn speed if they did lots of digging yesterday
- Three additional pockets of water and oxygen are now generated in the world, just below the surface
- Increased the "dangerously low" oxygen level for pawns from 25% to 30%
- Pawns now catch their breath until their oxygen levels are back to 100% (was 25%)
- Reduced the maximum length of the _solar flare_ event by 25%

### Internal

- Added current keybindings list to `readme.txt`, until there's a proper control panel or configurable key list
- Added "Report on Discord" link to error capture screen
- Added check âœ” to selected items in dropdown menus
- Game actions can now be done while paused â€“ no need to unpause the game to apply changes
- Improved the way that sprites are animated between ticks during a game pause
- Reduced the size of world action buttons so more can fit on the screen at once
- The UI scale range in options is now rounded to the nearest 5%, to improve accessibility â€“ please let me know if this is too big or small!
- Added border around the screen when the game is paused
- Errands that were only accessible by dead pawns are no longer shown as accessible
- Alerts that refer to a fixed-period event are now closeable

### Fixes

- Fix dropdown hover not aligning up with dropdown contents
- Fix a (very) rare crash if absorbed or stored mass in an object was nearly zero
- Fix pending building outlines being hidden by doors and other animated buildings
- Fix after applying settings, the menu screen behind the options panel could be dismissed with escape
- Fix a bug where the game world and buttons could be interacted with with an open dialog (e.g. welcome, end of game)
- Fix a crash where trying to build a ladder near the edges of the world
- Fix a rare crash when a game event could be triggered before the UI had finished loading
- Fix reading one pawns' diary entries would mark ALL pawn diary entries as read
- Fix digging tiles off-screen would sometimes not be displayed correctly until another tile was dug in that same chunk
- Fix a bug where pawns at the bottom of a 1-wide tile refused to do errands unless they had another accessible space next to them
- Fix tile information on hover showing what items are buried, now it shows "(buried item)"
- Fix mouse cursor occasionally getting stuck when clicking a link
- Fix credits dialog close X was not positioned in the header
