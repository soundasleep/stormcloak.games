I've finished most of the [new liquid and gas shaders](/2023/02/21/new-liquid-shaders)
and they feel a _lot_ nicer. Here's a video comparing the before and after:

I'll be using these new beautiful graphics
to update the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/) for Alpha 3,
which I think will help with wishlists a lot!

Over the weekend I also quickly put together a brand new mechanic.
One of the issues with Alpha 2 is that it's not clear where buildings need to be connected in order
to be powered:

Now when you start to build wires â€“ or use the keyboard shortcut `F4` â€“
you'll be switched to the **power layer** which shows all of the connection
points for all the buildings, and whether they're powered:

</figure>

The graphics are inspired by both Rimworld's and Oxygen Not Included's approaches,
which I both really like! And yes, I'm intentionally using the iconography of
[Australia/New Zealand power sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS/NZS_3112)
because I think they're great ðŸ˜…
