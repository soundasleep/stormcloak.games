It's certainly been an odd week. Last week I finished up at my previous role
(and it was a really wonderful sendoff. I'm going to miss those peeps)
and it's exciting, confusing, thrilling, terrifying, relaxing having so much of my calendar
and time back. So many emotions!!

Because a big part of this journey is recovering from burnout, I'm trying not
to push myself to do things too much, so I don't have a lot to show off. And that's OK!

I'm still not used to the idea of "hey, you don't need to work on this right now;
you've got all day tomorrow, too." But I'm finding having something to focus on helpful.

As far as I can tell (and I'm still a newbie
at this, mind you), I believe I'm in the prototyping/preproduction phase of game development.
I found this [really helpful talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DWdnoLosZ8):

And what I'm prototyping at the moment is different gameplay systems to see
which ones are fun, which ones are possible, which ones suck. As this game is
based around resource management, this week I've been exploring ideas around
renewable resources.

Perhaps plants?
