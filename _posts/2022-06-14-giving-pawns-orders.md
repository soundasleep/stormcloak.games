Over the last week, I've been improving how to give orders and errands to your pawns.
While they'll normally be autonomous, sometimes you might need to help them get
out of a hole. Which they may have dug themselves into.

So, I've added a "move to..." command:

You can also now cycle through all of the things present on a tile.
Each selection dialog shows you more information, such as
what the thing is made out of, what it's doing, and why:

And finally, I've spent some time making the pawns a bit smarter.
Before, they were just doing errands somewhat randomly â€“ they would select the nearest
errand, but they wouldn't care if there was somebody closer who could do it.

Now pawns will work together to complete the errands closer to them:

These are all necessary user interface things for any base-builder/survival
game, and I'll be expanding on these mechanics in the future as more features
and gameplay is added! ðŸ˜Š
