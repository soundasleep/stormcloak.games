_Steam Next Fest_ is a week-long celebration of upcoming games, and more importantly,
it will be the first time _Adaptory_ will be available on Steam.
The goal is to get as much feedback and as many wishlists as possible, so please do join the party.
The new demo build has new features, art, sound, gameplay, and a ton of bug fixes, and I can't wait
to share our hard work.

Here's everything that's going to be happen over the next two weeks! (You can also stay in the loop on
[Discord](/discord),
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@stormcloak),
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StormcloakGames), where I'll be posting updates.)

### Today

If you haven't already seen the video, there's a [brand new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zie51sT-bMI),
just for Next Fest:

The [_Adaptory_ Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/) has also
had an overhaul, with new text, GIFs, and screenshots. I'm in the process of getting
the page translated to a number of different languages, as well. (The demo will only be available in
English, but I want to make it clear the full game will be localised!)

### <relative-time datetime="2024-01-31T14:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" prefix="" month="long" weekday="long">Wednesday 31 January (PST)</relative-time>

Jevon is going to try her first ever [dev livestream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soundasleep)!
This is going to be a real experiment, not exactly sure how this will go ðŸ˜€
I plan to start the stream at <relative-time datetime="2024-01-31T14:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" hour="numeric" prefix="" day="" month="" weekday="" timeZoneName="long">2pm PST</relative-time>. <a class="calendar" target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=Mmc3cGhlNDQyOW9qcTg4MWhwbmQ2OGNrdWggamV2b25Ac3Rvcm1jbG9hay5nYW1lcw&amp;tmsrc=jevon%40stormcloak.games"><img border="0" src="https://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button1_en-GB.gif"></a>

On stream, I'll probably be tweaking art, adding content, fixing bugs, or maybe just hanging out with chat.
Come hang out and I might add your ideas to the game, too.
It's been a long time since I last streamed ðŸ˜…

### <relative-time datetime="2024-02-01T16:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" prefix="" month="long" weekday="long">Thursday 1 February</relative-time>

Adaptory's Demo will [be released on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2786010/),
and anyone can download a copy and **play it for free!** ðŸ¥³ <a class="calendar" target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=NWw2aGZwbGFtMnJzM2RiN252ODA2ZmlkMzkgamV2b25Ac3Rvcm1jbG9hay5nYW1lcw&amp;tmsrc=jevon%40stormcloak.games"><img border="0" src="https://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button1_en-GB.gif"></a>

The version we'll be releasing next week has new systems, content, and heaps of bug fixes.
There are no limitations in this demo; you can play for as long as you want,
but this version will _only_ be released on Steam.

Hopefully there won't be any major issues once the game goes live,
but I've got automated tests, builds, and release processes set up,
so it should be easy to make last-minute changes!

### <relative-time datetime="2024-02-05T10:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" prefix="" month="long" weekday="long">Monday 5 February (PST)</relative-time>

Steam Next Fest launches today at <relative-time datetime="2024-02-05T10:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" hour="numeric" prefix="" day="" month="" weekday="" timeZoneName="long">10am PST</relative-time>.
For _Algorithm Reasons&trade;_, it would be really helpful if you're able
to [download and play a copy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/)
of the demo today â€“ the more downloads and plays,
the more likely the game will be featured across Steam ðŸ˜Š

</figure>

We will also be **livestreaming the game** later that day at <relative-time datetime="2024-02-05T14:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" hour="numeric" prefix="" day="" month="" weekday="" timeZoneName="long">10am PST</relative-time>.
This stream is going to be featured across all of Steam! I'll be playing the game
with special guest and friend [ThisIsRubyOK](https://www.twitch.tv/thisisrubyok),
showing off some of the new systems, and answering questions. Come join in and say hi!!

We'll be doing another **featured livestream**, likely at <relative-time datetime="2024-02-07T08:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" hour="numeric" prefix="" day="" month="" weekday="" timeZoneName="long">8am PST</relative-time>. (Just waiting to hear back from Steam support!) <a class="calendar" target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=M2FtYTZyazFlNTdibW1lNGFkZmRibmdxMDQgamV2b25Ac3Rvcm1jbG9hay5nYW1lcw&amp;tmsrc=jevon%40stormcloak.games"><img border="0" src="https://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button1_en-GB.gif"></a>

### <relative-time datetime="2024-02-12T10:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" prefix="" month="long" weekday="long">Monday 12 February (PST)</relative-time>

Steam Next Fest ends at <relative-time datetime="2024-02-12T10:00:00-08:00" format="datetime" hour="numeric" prefix="" day="" month="" weekday="" timeZoneName="long">10am PST</relative-time>. I'm planning to keep the Steam Demo live after this date,
but I might need to turn it off if something unexpected occurs. We'll then have a bit of a breather, review all of the feedback,
and maybe make an announcement of the Early Access release date?!

A huge, huge thank you to everyone who has played any version of _Adaptory_
over the [last two years](/2022/04/30/first-playable-release),
provided feedback, bug reports, and support â€“ especially
[everyone in the Adaptory discord](/discord) and friends from NZGDA.
The game feels really polished compared to a year ago and I am
nervous and excited to share it with the world ðŸ˜Š
