I'm really thrilled to be able to share this news: Adaptory has been
[announced as a successful applicant](https://www.nzfilm.co.nz/news/interactive-development-fund-annoucement-0)
to the [NZFC's Whakawhanake Te Ao Niko â€“ Interactive Development Fund](https://www.nzfilm.co.nz/funds/whakawhanake-te-ao-niko-interactive-development-fund)!!

The news hasn't quite settled in yet, but we're honoured to be
alongside some really inspiring projects from other New Zealand studios.
This grant unlocks some funding which we'll be putting into developing
the character generation, diaries, and story-telling events of Adaptory.

Thank you so much NZFC!
