We are really thrilled to share that this morning, _Adaptory_ has been
[announced as a Kick Start recipient](https://www.nz-code.nz/post/code-s-inaugural-national-funding-round-supports-game-developers-with-1m-in-grants)

This grant and support will help us continue to improve the user interface
and unique gameplay of Adaptory as we get ready
for our [Early Access launch in 2025](/2024/02/14/next-fest-whats-next).
(We will be releasing the first public screenshots of the new user interface
in the next week or two!)

Over the last year, CODE's support has levelled up every aspect of
our game studio, from running a successful business, to marketing a product, pitching to publishers, and developing our international presence.
We are honoured to be a recipient, and to be listed among
[these other incredible titles](https://www.nz-code.nz/post/code-s-inaugural-national-funding-round-supports-game-developers-with-1m-in-grants).

Thank you again so much, CODE <3
