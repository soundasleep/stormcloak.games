I'm very excited to share that we will be at [Gamescom KÃ¶ln](https://www.gamescom.global/en) in August!!

And as soon as we're done in Germany, we're flying straight back home to attend [NZGDC](https://nzgdc.com/) here in Wellington,
and hopefully present Adaptory at the [Kiwi Interactive Showcase](https://nzgdc.com/schedule/kiwi-interactive-showcase/).

The trip is partially funded by [CODE NZ](https://www.codedunedin.nz/), who have been incredibly supportive!
New Zealand is extremely lucky to have this organisation supporting NZ gamedevs.

While we're there, I'll take some photos and share them [on Patreon](https://patreon.com/jevon) ðŸ˜€
