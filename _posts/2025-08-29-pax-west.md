After an _amazing_ [Gamescom experience](/2025/07/06/gamescom), I'm excited to share
that Adaptory will be part of [PAX West 2025](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2201620/view/508464193954906785)
starting tomorrow in Boston!
You can check out Adaptory and five other indie.io games at **booth 1115**.

While I'm not able to be there this time (and I'm still recovering from the travel),
you'll be able to learn more about Adaptory on the show floor,
and play the latest version of the game – including a preview of ALL
of the content coming exclusively to Early Access.

Thanks to everyone who attended our lil' booth at [Indie Arena Booth last week](/2025/07/06/gamescom) –
we both had an amazing time, met so many amazing games and new friends, ate a lot of vegan hot dogs,
and we ran out of cards to give away (twice!!). I hope we're able to attend again soon!
