I've been such a busy little beaver this month! One of the two major branches
I've been working on is now complete... pawns now have hair styles, thanks to [@careously](https://twitter.com/careously)!

You'll see the pawns' hair at the start of the game, and also when they're
not assigned to a specific job. At the moment, the hair style (along with
[pants and shirts](/2022/09/05/now-with-colour)) is assigned randomly,
based on their gender (m/f/x).

In this update, I've also added little progress bars to pawns digging and building.
This was such a simple feature, but it's added so much depth. Pawns can now also be
interrupted – for example, if while they're building, someone removes
the tile under them – but their progress is not lost.

I've also accepted it's not going to be possible to get [the early alpha out this month](/2022/05/18/announcing-adaptory)...
it's so close, but I want the game to be somewhat playable, with at least
15 minutes of gameplay.

Based on the 12 epics remaining, you can expect the first alpha to be **released in October**!
As an early alpha/demo, it will be free and available to everyone,
and I'd love to read your feedback.
