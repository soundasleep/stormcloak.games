Hello! This is just a quick note that Alpha 7 is _almost_ here,
but not quite. The plan was to release it tomorrow but I'm going to
take an extra couple of days to clean up a few remaining bugs
and add a little bit more content.

Alpha 7 may be our last alpha before Early Access so the
[focus of the release is technology](/2023/11/18/save-game).
We should then be able to focus entirely
on content and systems over the summer break.

The release date is just **one week away** â€“ 21 December 2023. This means
you'll have a brand new build to play in time for the break, but it also
should mean I won't end up fixing bugs on a public holiday ðŸ˜…
