## 1. Introduction

Stormcloak Limited (**we**, **us**, **our**) complies with the [New Zealand Privacy Act 2020](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0031/latest/LMS23223.html) (the **Act**) when dealing with personal information.  Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).

This policy sets out how we will collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.

This policy does not limit or exclude any of your rights under the Act.  If you wish to seek further information on the Act, see [privacy.org.nz](https://privacy.org.nz).

## 2. Changes to this policy

We may change this policy by uploading a revised policy onto the website.  The change will apply from the date that we upload the revised policy.

## 3. Who we collect your personal information from

We collect personal information about you from:

- you, when you provide that personal information to us, including via the website and any related service, through any registration or subscription process, through any contact with us (e.g. telephone call or email), or when you buy or use our services and products
- third parties where you have authorised this or the information is publicly available.

If possible, we will collect personal information from you directly.

## 4. How we use your personal information

We will use your personal information:

- to provide services and products to you
- to market our services and products to you, including contacting you electronically (e.g. by text or email for this purpose)
- to improve the services and products that we provide to you
- to respond to communications from you, including a complaint
- to conduct research and statistical analysis (on an anonymised basis)
- to protect and/or enforce our legal rights and interests, including defending any claim
- for any other purpose authorised by you or the Act.

## 5. Specific information collected

If while running our game, you have enabled the automatic upload of **crash data** and a crash or exception occurs,
the following information may be shared with us over the internet, so we can help improve the game for other players:

- the stacktrace of the crash, including any relevant debug data
- the version of the game running and its dependencies
- your locale
- the name and version of your operating system
- the name and version of your graphics card
- the total, and available, memory and hard drive space
- the world state of your game at the time of the crash

If you have enabled the automatic upload of **play data**, the following information may be shared with us over the internet at regular intervals:

- your unique, but anonymous, player GUID
- how long you have been playing the game
- the current world state of the game

In both cases, this information should not contain any personally identifying information and will only be used to improve our game.

In [Adaptory](https://adaptorygame.com), you can permanently enable or disable ALL data collection by going into _Options > Data collection_, or by launching the game with the command line argument `-Dprivacy=1` ("privacy mode").

- any other person authorised by the Act or another law (e.g. a law enforcement agency)
- any other person authorised by you.

A business that supports our services and products may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean your Personal Information may be held and processed outside New Zealand.
