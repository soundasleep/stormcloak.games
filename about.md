**Stormcloak Games** is a brand new game development studio based in Wellington, New Zealand.

Behind the curtain, though, it's just [@soundasleep](https://twitter.com/soundasleep) doing everything.

Right now I'm working on a game that's shaping up to be a fascinating and deep 2D base builder/colony/survival sim, deeply inspired by Oxygen Not Included, Rimworld, and Stardew Valley.
(And no, the game doesn't have a name yet.)
