Our first game is called _[Adaptory](https://adaptorygame.com)_, and is
an upcoming base-building survival game, combining multiple complex simulations with a story-rich world.
Deeply inspired by Oxygen Not Included, Rimworld, and Dwarf Fortress,
the game will be [released into Steam Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201620/Adaptory/) in 2025,
published with the [support of indie.io](/2024/08/09/publisher-announcement).
