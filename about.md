**Stormcloak Games** is a brand new game development studio based in Wellington, New Zealand.

Behind the curtain, though, it's just [@soundasleep](https://twitter.com/soundasleep) doing everything.

Right now I'm working on a game that's shaping up to be a base builder/colony sim, deeply inspired by Oxygen Not Included, Rimworld, and Stardew Valley.
And no, it doesn't have a name yet.

Under the hood, there's a [complex element simulation](_posts/2022-01-27-element-sim.md) going on.
Tiles hold a single element (along with its mass, temperature, and other attributes) and
the simulation uses element attributes such as
viscosity, density, compressibility, and thermal conductivity to simulate each step.

There's lots more depth coming. For more details, check out the [blog](blog.md).
